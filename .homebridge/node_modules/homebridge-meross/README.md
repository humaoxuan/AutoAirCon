### Plugin Information

- This plugin allows you to view and control your Meross devices within HomeKit. The plugin:
  - downloads a device list if your Meross credentials are supplied
  - attempts to control your devices locally, reverting to cloud control if necessary
  - listens for real-time device updates when controlled externally
  - supports configuring devices for local-only control without your Meross credentials
  - can ignore any HomeKit-native devices you have using the configuration

### Prerequisites

- Whilst it is recommended to use [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16, the plugin supports v14 as per the [Homebridge guidelines](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/How-To-Update-Node.js).
